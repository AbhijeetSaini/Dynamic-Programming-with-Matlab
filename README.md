# Dynamic Programming with Matlab
 Model predictive control of hybrid electric vehicles is achieved by using dynamic programming operating over a shortened horizon time interval.

Optimal control of hybrid electric vehicles (and other systems) can be achieved using dynamic programming. Model predictive control of hybrid electric vehicles was achieved by using dynamic programming operating over a shortened horizon time interval. This project was designed to introduce dynamic programming. A simplified plant model and limited control input range were used to introduce the concept of dynamic programming without adding the complexity associated with HEV modelling.
